		I graduated from DePaul University with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and minors in Professional Writing and Industrial 
		&amp; Organizational Psychology. While at DePaul, I earned a Leadership Certificate from the Student Leadership Institute and served 
		as student mentor for first-year students. 
		</li>
		<li>
		While being a full-time undergraduate student, I also worked for the U.S. Department of State as a Program Assistant. My responsibilities 
		ranged from administrative to management. I performed receptionist tasks, but also built and maintained databases, ran the drafting of 
		various publications, coordinated meetings and conferences, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
		The course assignments I completed for my Professional Writing minor coupled with my project experiences at the State Department motivated 
		me to pursue a degree in Technical Communication and Information Design at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I realized that I enjoyed 
		organizing and managing information, whether that information is in the form of words in a newsletter or that information is data in a content 
		management system.
