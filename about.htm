		<li>
		<p>I graduated from DePaul University with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and minors in Professional Writing and Industrial 
		&amp; Organizational Psychology. While at DePaul, I earned a Leadership Certificate from the Student Leadership Institute and served 
		as student mentor for first-year students.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>While being a full-time undergraduate student, I also worked for the U.S. Department of State as a Program Assistant. My responsibilities 
		ranged from administrative to management to information design. I developed and maintained databases, managed the drafting of 
		various publications, coordinated meetings and conferences, etc.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The course assignments I completed for my Professional Writing minor coupled with my project experiences at the State Department motivated 
		me to pursue a degree in Technical Communication and Information Design at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I realized that I enjoyed 
		organizing and managing information, whether that information is in the form of words in a newsletter or that information is data in a content 
		management system. To further my career development in information management, I now work as a Product Management Intern for Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LTD's Office of Information Management.</p>
