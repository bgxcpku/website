		I wrote this proposal to improve the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool for a class on Chicago 
		Public Spaces at DePaul University. I took an existing proposal for renovation and added additional arguments 
		for moving forward with the improvements. Most of the images of the lily pool are my own. I presented this paper
		at the First Year Writing Showcase and won first prize.</li>
