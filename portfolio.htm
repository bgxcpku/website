<p class="intro">
My portfolio is a collection of items that represent my diverse skillset and experience. They are mainly academic, but show
 off my technical, research, and design skills.
</p>


	<ul>
    <li class="title" >Newsletter</li>
		<li class="image">
        <a href="pdf/newsletter.pdf"> 
		    <img class="image" src="img/computerscience.PNG" alt="Document Design Newsletter" />
		    </a>
    </li>
		<li class="caption">
			This newsletter was created collaboratively using Adobe InDesign for a group project
		in Document Design at Illinois Institute of Technology. Our group used Robin Williams' four basic design principles (proximity,
		alignment, repeitition, and contrast) to guide our design choices. Color was used significantly
		to group similar information.</li>	
		
    <li class="title">Proposal</li>
    <li class="image"><a href="pdf/lilypoolfinal.pdf">
		<img class="image" src="img/lilypool.PNG" alt="Lily Pool Proposal" />
		</a></li>
		<li class="caption">
		I wrote this proposal to improve the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool for a class on Chicago 
		Public Spaces at DePaul University. I took an existing proposal for renovation and added additional arguments 
		for moving forward with the improvements. Most of the images of the lily pool are my own. I presented this paper
		at the First Year Writing Showcase and won first prize.</li>

    <li class="title">Course Management Site Presentation</li>
    <li class="image"><a href="pdf/blackboard.pdf"><img class="image" src="img/ppt.PNG" alt="Blackboard Presentation" />
		</a></li>
    <li class="caption">I created this PowerPoint Presentation for my presentation to new freshmen mentors.
		I taught them how to navigate the course management system for freshmen mentors and how to customize the course management system
		for their own classes. I had been a Writing Intern for DePaul's Freshmen Mentor Program, organizing and redesigning their content management system, and
		 rewriting and creating course materials.</li>

    <li class="title">Thesis</li>
    <li class="image"><a href="pdf/thesis.pdf"><img class="image" src="img/thesis.PNG" alt="Thesis" />
		</a></li>
    <li class="caption">After reading Amartya Sen's "Development as Freedom", I had been fascinated with the country, Singapore. Growing up in a democratic country, it
	 seemed odd how a country, with an arguably authoritarian country, could have one of the highest happiness ratings in the world. This thesis investigates the idea of the "good life" in Singapore 
	and compares it to differing ideas in other countries and cultures.
 This thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach by drawing from theories in political science, economics, philosophy, and psychology.	</li>

    <li class="title">User Experience Report</li>
    <li class="image"><a href="pdf/survey.pdf"><img class="image" src="img/yelp.PNG" alt="Yelp Survey Results" />
		</a></li>
    <li class="caption">This Yelp iPhone App Survey Report was created for my User Experience class. My group created a satisfaction survey using Google Forms. Individually, we
	 had to write a report. I used descriptive and analytical statistics to analyze the data. The results are contained here in the report.</li>
