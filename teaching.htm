		<h2>Customizing Course Management System</h2>
		<ul class="portfolio">
			<li class="image"><a href="pdf/ppt.pdf"><img src="img/ppt.PNG" alt="Blackboard Presentation" /></a></li>
			<li class="caption">
			<p>As a Writing Intern for DePaul University's First Year Program, I organized and redesigned their <em>course management system</em> and
			revised and authored new course materials. The Associate Director asked me to give a presentation to new student mentors on how to 
			navigate the newly redesigned course management system and teach them how to customize their own systems. I created this <em>PowerPoint</em> for my presentation to 
			over 100 new freshmen mentors. I showed them not only how to design their own systems, but also how to take advantage of the features, like surveys and discussion boards, and
			 connect them with the larger learning goals of the DePaul University's First Year Program, such as Sense of Belonging and Community and Environmental Sustainability.

		<h2>Time Management</h2>
		<ul class="portfolio">
			<li class="image"><a href="pdf/workshop.pdf"><img src="img/workshop.png" alt="Time Management Workshop" /></a></li>
			<li class="caption">
			<p>As a freshmen mentor, I made it a priority to customize my lesson plans to fit my students' needs. The first year program was built around pre-written
			syllabi and lesson plans, which is great because starting from scratch is always a long process. However, I was always conscious to not deliver the lessons systematically. 
			Especially around midterms, I would have students reflect on their progress as a whole. One theme that came up was issues with <em>time management</em>. 
			In order to address this problem, I put together a time management activity. This activity forced students to detail how they spent their time. 
			The goal was to have them see how they were spending their time. It was an eye-opening experience for many of my students and they were really 
			grateful for the activity.</p></li>
