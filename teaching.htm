		<p class="intro">
			Below are documents I used to facilitate presentations where I taught students how to do something or workshops. I have additional experience creating instructional documents
			on using software or office procedures.

		<h2>Customizing Course Management System</h2>
		<ul class="portfolio">
			<li class="image"><a href="pdf/ppt.pdf"><img src="img/ppt.PNG" alt="Blackboard Presentation" /></a></li>
			<li class="caption">
			<p>I had been a Writing Intern for DePaul's Freshmen Mentor Program, organizing and redesigning their course management system, and
			rewriting and creating course materials. The Associate Director asked me to give a presentation at the mentor kick-off on the newly redesigned system and how they 
			can customize their own systems. I created this PowerPoint for my presentation to new freshmen mentors.
			I taught them how to navigate the course management system for freshmen mentors and how to customize the course management system
			for their own classes. </p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Time Management</h2>
		<ul class="portfolio">
			<li class="image"><a href="pdf/workshop.pdf"><img src="img/workshop.png" alt="Time Management Workshop" /></a></li>
			<li class="caption">
			<p>As a freshmen mentor, I made it a priority to customize my lesson plans to fit my students. The first year program was built around pre-written
			syllabi and lesson plans, which is great because starting from scratch is always a long process, but I was always conscious to not deliver word-for-word. 
			Especially around midterms, I would have students reflect on their progress as a whole. One theme that came up was issues with time management. 
			In order to address this problem, I put together a time management actively. This activity forced students to detail how they spent their time. 
			The goal was to have them see how they were spending their time. It was an eye-opening experience for many of my students and they were really 
			grateful for the activity.</p></li>
